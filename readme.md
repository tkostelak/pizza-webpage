#### Epicodus exercise utilizing objects in Javascript, 01/31/2018

#### By **Tyler Kostelak**

## Description

This webpage collects data from the user and creates a personalized pizza based on the inputted values. The prototype, pizzaCost, calculates the cost of each Pizza that is iterated in a constructor with Javascript branching statements.

* $2 is added to the total cost for each size increase (medium, large, extra-large).
* Sauce does not cost extra.
* $2 is added to the price for each topping added, but any topping after the 4th topping is free.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index file and open it in your browser (Chrome is preferred).
* Open the scripts.js file to in your preferred text editor to view the javascript scripts.
* Open the javascript console in your browser in order to explore the page further.

## Known Bugs

At this time, the webpage does not always create the correct price for multiple pizzas, but is always correct on the first pizza.

## Support and contact details

If you have suggestions for how to help me make any additions, or if you have other feedback, please feel free to contact me at tkostelak@gmail.com. All feedback is welcome, keep in mind that the primary focus of this project is Javascript/Jquery, so I am not necessarily looking for HTML/CSS advice. Thanks for understanding!

## Technologies Used

*HTML
*CSS
*Jquery
*Javascript- even a large section of the page's HTML is appended in a javascript function and is modified by CSS classes, which is a very useful feature of both programs.
